In the winter of 1815, after countless millions had perished, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end. The little corporal Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France for the decade previous, was exiled to the volcanic island of St Helena where he would see out the last six years of his life.

The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the start of a great agricultural depression in the United Kingdom that would last for a quarter of a century. Many farms succumbed to abandonment and disrepair as both landlords and tenants fell into bankruptcy.

It is in the wake of this ruin, far from the bloody fields of Waterloo and Rocquencourt, that you find yourself standing on a long farm road in Suffolk, surrounded by patchwork fields of oat, barley and wheat. A dull lifelessness hangs in the air like the fog of war. All is silent, save for the cries of carrion crow circling above.

Five hundred miles away, a young author called Mary Shelley has finished writing her first novel, &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;...

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. This is real.&quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

The Scarecrow
A short Napoleonic agricultural chiller by Mikey Hogarth The story genre is &quot;Horror&quot;
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough.

The Lobby
 As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a murder of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch. 

You can see a shelf (on which is a clock) here.

As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The kitchen
You enter a food preparation area towards the rear of the cottage. An iron-bake oven is here hung on a trammel over a fire pit. There is an old oak table in the centre of the room, and a cupboard against the far wall.

To the north is the lobby.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

Front Of The Cottage
You approach the front of a large two storey cottage that is very familiar to you. A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.  

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

The cat tilts his head to one side.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

The French cavalry charged the British line of infantry three different times, and did much execution, until we were obliged to form squares of battalions, in order to turn them, which was executed in a most gallant manner, and many hundreds of them never returned. Still, they sent up French forces and as often we beat them them back. The battle lasted until it was quite dark, when the enemy began to give way, our poor fellows who were left alive following them as long as they could see, when night put an end to the fatigues of a well fought day. Thousands on both sides lay killed and wounded on the field of battle; and, as the greater part of the action lay in corn fields along a vast track of country, many hundreds must have died for want of assistance through the night, who were not able of themselves to crawl away.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

You feel a cool breeze.

The cat meows.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The scarecrow has left his post!

 You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
 As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a murder of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch. 

You can see a shelf (on which is a clock) here.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The scarecrow&apos;s head is made from a hessian sack, onto which has been drawn the approximation of a face. You can not tell whether the scarecrow is smiling or frowning, and his eyes stare blankly through you. The scarecrow is soaked through with rain - he has clearly been standing in this field for some time.

As you stare at the scarecrow, you feel a deep nausea as you come to accept an affinity with him. You consider the folly in his defence of fields that have been abandoned and ravaged by disease. His battlefield is a barren waste, his war over. He has been standing here so long, the crows are no longer afraid of him. Perhaps now the fight is over, they are his only companions.

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling. The wind here is chill, and the crows are legion.

The Scarecrow
A short Napoleonic agricultural chiller by Mikey Hogarth The story genre is &quot;Horror&quot;
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Living room
The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

You can see an old desk (on which is a piece of paper) here.

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. 

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

You are in the food preparation area towards the rear of the cottage. An iron-bake oven is here hung on a trammel over a fire pit. There is an old oak table in the centre of the room, and a cupboard against the far wall.

To the north is the lobby.

You can see page one of a letter here.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

You approach the front of a large two storey cottage that is very familiar to you. A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.  

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

The cat wags his tail violently from side to side.

You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

    <result xml:space="preserve">You kneel down and hold your arm out towards the cat, who responds by rubbing his face against your hand and purring loudly. He seems more comfortable around you now.

The cat arches his shoulders and attempts to sneak up on a nearby crow, but it flies away moments before he pounces.

The cat appears to be carrying a black feather in his mouth. He deposits the feather on the ground in front of you and stares up at you, seeking some kind of praise.

You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.  

You can see a black feather and the cat here.

The cat begins scratching in the undergrowth.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Living room
The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Living room
The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

You can see an old desk (on which is a piece of paper) here.

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling. The wind here is chill, and the crows are legion.

The Scarecrow
A short Napoleonic agricultural chiller by Mikey Hogarth The story genre is &quot;Horror&quot;
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. Your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, to sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. You take a moment to gather your composure and you tell yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive.&quot;.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

In the winter of 1815, after countless millions had perished, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end. The little corporal Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France for the decade previous, was exiled to the volcanic island of St Helena where he would see out the last six years of his life.

The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the start of a great agricultural depression in the United Kingdom that would last for a quarter of a century. Many farms succumbed to abandonment and disrepair as both landlords and tenants fell into bankruptcy.

It is in the wake of this ruin, far from the bloody fields of Waterloo and Rocquencourt, that you find yourself standing on a long farm road in Suffolk, surrounded by patchwork fields of oat, barley and wheat. A dull lifelessness hangs in the air like the fog of war. All is silent, save for the cries of carrion crow circling above.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite. 

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The little corporal Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France for the decade previous, was exiled to the volcanic island of St Helena where he would see out the last six years of his life.

The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the start of a great agricultural depression in the United Kingdom that would last for a quarter of a century. Many farms succumbed to abandonment and disrepair as both landlords and tenants fell into bankruptcy.

It is in the wake of this ruin, far from the bloody fields of Waterloo and Rocquencourt, that you find yourself standing on a long farm road in Suffolk, surrounded by fields of oat, barley and wheat.

The Scarecrow

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite. 

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The scarecrow&apos;s head is made from a hessian sack, onto which has been drawn the approximation of a face. You can not tell whether the scarecrow is smiling or frowning, and his eyes stare blankly through you. The scarecrow is soaked through with rain - he has clearly been standing in this field for some time.

As you stare at the scarecrow, you feel a deep nausea as you come to accept an affinity with him. You consider the folly in his defence of fields that have been abandoned and ravaged by disease. His battlefield is a barren waste, his war over. He has been standing here so long, the crows are no longer afraid of him. Perhaps now the fight is over, they are his only companions.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage. The fields continue off into the distance in all directions.  

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken turnwrest plough.

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. The scarecrow has left his post! You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.
