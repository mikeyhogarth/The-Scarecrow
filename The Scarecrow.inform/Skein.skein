In the winter of 1815, after countless millions had perished, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end. The little corporal Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France for the last decade, was exiled to the volcanic island of St Helena where he would see out the last six years of his life.

The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the start of a great agricultural depression in the United Kingdom that would last for a quarter of a century. Many farms succumbed to abandonment and disrepair as both landlords and tenants fell into bankruptcy.

It is in the wake of this ruin, far from the bloody fields of Waterloo and Rocquencourt, that you find yourself standing on a long farm road in Suffolk, surrounded by patchwork fields of oat, barley and wheat. A dull lifelessness hangs in the air like the fog of war. All is silent, save for the cries of carrion crow circling above.

Five hundred miles away, a young author called Mary Shelley has just completed her first novel, &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;...

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. This is real.&quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling. The wind here is chill, and the crows are legion.

The Scarecrow
A short Napoleonic agricultural chiller by Mikey Hogarth The story genre is &quot;Horror&quot;
Release 1 / Serial number 130928 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

The Lobby
 As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a murder of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch. 

You can see a shelf (on which is a clock) here.

As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The kitchen
You enter a food preparation area towards the rear of the cottage. An iron-bake oven is here hung on a trammel over a fire pit. There is an old oak table in the centre of the room, and a cupboard against the far wall.

To the north is the lobby.

The Scarecrow
A short Napoleonic agricultural chiller by Mikey Hogarth The story genre is &quot;Horror&quot;
Release 1 / Serial number 130929 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The stench of death is here, exemplified by the many dying and disease-ravaged crops left to abandonment in the surrounding fields. The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Front Of The Cottage
You approach the front of a large two storey cottage that is very familiar to you. A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.

The crows continue to circle and caw all around, landing on the various protrusions on and around the cottage. 

You feel suddenly very sad, as if there is something at work in your soul which you do not understand.   

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The French cavalry charged the British line of infantry three different times, and did much execution, until we were obliged to form squares of battalions, in order to turn them, which was executed in a most gallant manner, and many hundreds of them never returned. Still, they sent up French forces and as often we beat them them back. The battle lasted until it was quite dark, when the enemy began to give way, our poor fellows who were left alive following them as long as they could see, when night put an end to the fatigues of a well fought day. Thousands on both sides lay killed and wounded on the field of battle; and, as the greater part of the action lay in corn fields along a vast track of country, many hundreds must have died for want of assistance through the night, who were not able of themselves to crawl away.

The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You approach the front of a large two storey cottage that is very familiar to you. A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.  

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

The cat blinks slowly.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You approach the front of a large two storey cottage that is very familiar to you. A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.  

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

The Lobby
 As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a murder of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch. 

You can see a shelf (on which is a clock) here.

Nothing can exceed the kindness and attention of the inhabitants of this city to our wounded men : the hospital is constantly filled with ladies and gentlemen, who, although speaking a different language, personally administer to our wants, with the kindest attention, distributing clean shirts, bread, wine, coffee, tea, milk and fruit of all sorts, with every requisite, for our comfort and accommodation.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The scarecrow is soaked through with rain - he has clearly been standing in this field for some time.

As you stare at the scarecrow, you feel a deep nausea as you come to accept an affinity with him. You consider the folly in his defence of fields that have been abandoned and ravaged by disease. His battlefield is a barren waste, his war over. He has been standing here so long, the crows are no longer afraid of him. Perhaps now the fight is over, they are his only companions.

The Scarecrow
A short Napoleonic agricultural chiller by Mikey Hogarth The story genre is &quot;Horror&quot;
Release 1 / Serial number 130929 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

A low mist hangs in the air. Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see the silhouette of a thatched cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage does not feel like an inviting respite.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Commands in interactive fiction are issued at the command prompt. You can go in any direction (e.g. &quot;go north&quot;) and you issue commands in natural English (e.g. &quot;take key&quot; or &quot;examine the tree&quot;). You can re-print a room description by typing &quot;look&quot;. Most common commands also have shortcuts, e.g. &quot;n&quot; will take you north, &quot;x&quot; will examine and &quot;l&quot; will look around. 

The intention with The Scarecrow is not to trick you - just try exploring and take in the world. Have fun!

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
You are in the lobby. The room is large and mostly empty, save for a few shelves. A kitchen is to the north, while to the west is a large living room.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

You can see the cat here.

The cat begins purring loudly.

The cat appears to be carrying a black feather in his mouth. He deposits the feather on the ground in front of you and stares up at you, seeking some kind of praise.

The Upstairs Hallway
You climb the creaky staircase and emerge in a small hallway. There are no windows up here, but the dim light from downstairs reveals an ominous looking door to the north. Light also emanates from the edges of the door, as if the door leads directly out into the open air.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the south.

The Bedroom
You hold your breath as you enter the room, and quickly infer that this once served as the cottage&apos;s bed chamber. The room is as sparse and dusty as the rest of the cottage, the only furniture here is a ramshackle bed frame and a dressing table, on which is a dusty mirror.Whoever had occupied this room has clearly vacated, but dusty footprints indicate that someone was definitely here.

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. 

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

He wanders the fields, surveying the aftermath to amuse his curiosity. He greets the soldier as a friend, even though the two are strangers. The people still people warm to him, though he claws at their humility only to stroke his wretched ego.

He offers meagre trifles, but he is not to be trusted. Damn him, for he is named  .

The Upstairs Hallway
You climb the creaky staircase and emerge in a small hallway. There are no windows up here, but the dim light from downstairs reveals an ominous looking door to the south. Light also emanates from the edges of the door, as if the door leads directly out into the open air.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the south.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. 

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The cat appears to be carrying a black feather in his mouth. He deposits the feather on the ground in front of you and stares up at you, seeking some kind of praise.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

You can see an old desk (on which is a piece of paper) here.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.  

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Living room
The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

You can see an old desk (on which is a piece of paper) here.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Upstairs Hallway
You climb the creaky staircase and emerge in a small hallway. There are no windows up here, but the dim light from downstairs reveals an ominous looking door to the south. Light also emanates from the edges of the door, as if the door leads directly out into the open air.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the south.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Upstairs Hallway
You climb the creaky staircase and emerge in a small hallway. There are no windows up here, but the dim light from downstairs reveals an ominous looking door to the north. Light also emanates from the edges of the door, as if the door leads directly out into the open air.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the south.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.  

You see a strange figure at one of the cottage&apos;s upper windows.  

You can see the cat here.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the north.

The Bedroom
You hold your breath as you enter the room, and you find yourself alone. You infer from the furniture that this room had once served as the cottage&apos;s bed chamber. The room is as sparse and dusty as the rest of the cottage, a ramshackle bed frame is situated against the east wall next to an old dressing table, on which is a dusty mirror. Light pours through a large window on the far wall.

Whoever had occupied this room has clearly vacated - only a set of dusty footprints indicate that anyone was ever here.

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. 

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.  

You can see the cat here.

The cat heads north to the barley field.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Upstairs Hallway
You climb the creaky staircase and emerge in a small hallway. There are no windows up here, but the dim light from downstairs reveals an ominous looking door to the north. Light also emanates from the edges of the door, as if the door leads directly out into the open air.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the south.

The Bedroom
You hold your breath as you enter the room, and quickly infer that this once served as the cottage&apos;s bed chamber. The room is as sparse and dusty as the rest of the cottage, the only furniture here is a ramshackle bed frame and a dressing table, on which is a dusty mirror. Light pours through a window on the far wall.Whoever had occupied this room has clearly vacated, but dusty footprints indicate that someone was definitely here.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Front Of The Cottage
You approach the front of a large two storey cottage that is very familiar to you. A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. 

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The Living room
The living room, as with the rest of the cottage, is very sparsely furnished and ridden with dust and cobwebs. As you enter, your eye is caught by a crow at the window. The crow lets out a blood curdling screech and flies out of view.

You can see an old desk (on which is a piece of paper) here.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.  

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

The cat wags his tail violently from side to side.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The stench of death is here, exemplified by the many dying and disease-ravaged crops left to abandonment in the surrounding fields. The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

The crows continue to circle and caw all around, landing on the various protrusions on and around the cottage.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Upstairs Hallway
You climb the creaky staircase and emerge in a small hallway. There are no windows up here, but the dim light from downstairs reveals an ominous looking door to the north. Light also emanates from the edges of the door, as if the door leads directly out into the open air.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the south.

Back of the Cottage
You arrive in an ample-sized clearing of trampled barley which serves as a yard for the cottage.

You feel a slight twinge in your knee and wince in pain as you correct yourself. In that instant your thoughts turn to musket fire and the mayhem of battle, and to the sharp and sudden trauma below your right femur. 

And to falling.

You take a moment to gather your composure. You close your eyes and begin repeating to yourself &quot;You are home. You are alive. &quot; Eventually you open your eyes and breathe in the cold country air.

On the perimeter of the clearing is an old, broken plough. You can also see an ancient gnarled tree here.

The scarecrow has left his post!

You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Lobby
As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a number of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

On one of the shelves you see an old clock.

The Bedroom
You hold your breath as you enter the room, and you find yourself alone. You infer from the furniture that this room had once served as the cottage&apos;s bed chamber. The room is as sparse and dusty as the rest of the cottage, a ramshackle bed frame is situated against the east wall next to an old dressing table, on which is a dusty mirror. Light pours through a large window on the far wall.

Whoever had occupied this room has clearly vacated - only a set of dusty footprints indicate that anyone was ever here.

The cat is smiling widely, revealing two yellowing fangs beneath his brownish lips. He begins to speak;
 &quot;Well done, my fine fellow, well done&quot; he says, jovially, &quot;Haha, nothing contributes so much to tranquilize the mind as a steady purpose! It wasn&apos;t easy but we bloody well did it didn&apos;t we! The enemy was nought but a pounder after all!&quot;
 The creature notices your confusion.
 &quot;I know, nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change, but don&apos;t you see lad, it&apos;s over!&quot; he spins his head around in almost a complete circle, gesturing to the surrounding landscape &quot;We won! You don&apos;t need to defend this land any more, you can return to your old life! Haha!&quot;
 The creature furrows his brow as he notices that you still don&apos;t quite understand what he is implying.
 &quot;Look&quot; he continues &quot;There is little point in you resuming your station here, boy, these fields are no longer in need of defence!&quot;
 He is clearly losing his patience at your lack of response. His voice takes on a sudden stern-ness.
 &quot;I desire what is good. Therefore, everyone who does not agree with me is a traitor. It is good that you have done this service for your kingdom, but your services are no longer required and therefore it is good that you should return to your old life. Unless, that is, you disagree with me?&quot;
 And with that, you feel the life drain out of you, and the sack, coat, boots, hat and trousers fall to the floor in a crumpled heap, splashing down unceremoniously into a puddle, in a field, in Suffolk.

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch.

The Upstairs Hallway
You climb the creaky staircase and emerge in a small hallway. There are no windows up here, but the dim light from downstairs reveals an ominous looking door to the north. Light also emanates from the edges of the door, as if the door leads directly out into the open air.

As the creaking of the floorboards subsides, you realise that you can hear a slow, deep breathing. It appears to be coming from the other side of the door to the north.

The Bedroom
You hold your breath as you enter the room, and you find yourself alone. You infer from the furniture that this room had once served as the cottage&apos;s bed chamber. The room is as sparse and dusty as the rest of the cottage, a ramshackle bed frame is situated against the east wall next to an old dressing table, on which is a dusty mirror. Light pours through a large window on the far wall.

Whoever had occupied this room has clearly vacated - only a set of dusty footprints indicate that anyone was here.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later reflected that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The stench of death is here, exemplified by the many dying and disease-ravaged crops left to abandonment in the surrounding fields. The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles and encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water was to be had on the road; however, we were brought up in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite. 

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds. And what do the birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, things like &quot;Poo-tee-weet&quot;. -- Kurt Vonnegut

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

In the winter of 1815, after countless millions had perished, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end. The little corporal Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France for the decade previous, was exiled to the volcanic island of St Helena where he would see out the last six years of his life.

The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the start of a great agricultural depression in the United Kingdom that would last for a quarter of a century. Many farms succumbed to abandonment and disrepair as both landlords and tenants fell into bankruptcy.

It is in the wake of this ruin, far from the bloody fields of Waterloo and Rocquencourt, that you find yourself standing on a long farm road in Suffolk, surrounded by patchwork fields of oat, barley and wheat. A dull lifelessness hangs in the air like the fog of war. All is silent, save for the cries of carrion crow circling above.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite .  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite. 

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The scarecrow&apos;s head is made from a hessian sack, onto which has been drawn the approximation of a face. You can not tell whether the scarecrow is smiling or frowning, and his eyes stare blankly through you. The scarecrow is soaked through with rain - he has clearly been standing in this field for some time.

As you stare at the scarecrow, you feel a deep nausea as you come to accept an affinity with him. You consider the folly in his defence of fields that have been abandoned and ravaged by disease. His battlefield is a barren waste, his war over. He has been standing here so long, the crows are no longer afraid of him. Perhaps now the fight is over, they are his only companions.

    <result xml:space="preserve">As you pick up the key, your heart jolts - you hear four loud bangs coming from the front of the cottage, like metal knocking on wood. The sound echoes around the hills and then all is silent again.

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. The scarecrow has left his post! You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.  

You feel a cool breeze.

The Barley Field

An old rotting wooden post is here. 

On the post is a note.

Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds. And what do the birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, things like &quot;Poo-tee-weet&quot;. -- Kurt Vonnegut
