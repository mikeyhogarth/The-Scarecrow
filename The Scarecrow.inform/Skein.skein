    <result xml:space="preserve">In the winter of 1815, after countless millions had perished, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end. The little corporal Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France for the decade previous, was exiled to the volcanic island of St Helena where he would see out the last six years of his life.

The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the start of a great agricultural depression in the United Kingdom that would last for a quarter of a century. Many farms succumbed to abandonment and disrepair as both landlords and tenants fell into bankruptcy.

It is in the wake of this ruin, far from the bloody fields of Waterloo and Rocquencourt, that you find yourself standing on a long farm road in Suffolk, surrounded by patchwork fields of oat, barley and wheat. A dull lifelessness hangs in the air like the fog of war. All is silent, save for the cries of carrion crow circling above.

Five hundred miles away, a young author called Mary Shelley has finished writing her first novel, &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;...

The Scarecrow
A short Napoleonic agricultural horror by Mikey Hogarth The story genre is &quot;Horror&quot;
Release 1 / Serial number 130927 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field. Similar fields lead off into the distance, separated from one another by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite.

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

The cat blinks slowly.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.  

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

As you make your way around the front of the cottage, you survey the area to see if you can identify the cause of the banging. Just as you are about to resign to having imagined the sound, you observe to your horror that the field to the north is now empty. The scarecrow has left his post! You can vaguely make out that something has been nailed to the post in place of the scarecrow, flapping gently in the breeze.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The French cavalry charged the British line of infantry three different times, and did much execution, until we were obliged to form squares of battalions, in order to turn them, which was executed in a most gallant manner, and many hundreds of them never returned. Still, they sent up French forces and as often we beat them them back. The battle lasted until it was quite dark, when the enemy began to give way, our poor fellows who were left alive following them as long as they could see, when night put an end to the fatigues of a well fought day. Thousands on both sides lay killed and wounded on the field of battle; and, as the greater part of the action lay in corn fields along a vast track of country, many hundreds must have died for want of assistance through the night, who were not able of themselves to crawl away.

Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Front Of The Cottage
You approach the front of a large two storey cottage that is very familiar to you. A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door.  

The small black cat from the farm path is here, washing himself among the barley.

The cat blinks slowly.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.  

You hear the harsh &quot;caw&quot; of a crow.

The Lobby
 As you enter the cottage through the heavy oak door, you disturb a murder of crows who were sheltering inside. A violent fury of black feathers whip past your face as the crows exit the cottage to join their brothers in the fields. 

The lobby itself is bare and largely unfurnished, with wooden floorboards that continue south into a food preparation area, and west into a large living room. A few shelves adorn the wall and a table sits against the western wall. You feel nauseous and short of breath. Surfaces feel cold and damp to the touch. 

You can see a shelf (on which is a clock) here.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite. 

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

General Hospital, Antwerp, 24th June 1815. After a long silence, I embrace the opportunity of informing you respecting my present situation. On the 15th, about 12 o&apos;clock at night, we turned out and at two in the morning marched from the city of Brussels, to meet the enemy, who were advancing in great force on that city. About three o&apos;clock in the afternoon of the 16th, we came up with them. Our whole force did not exceed 12,000 men, who were fatigued with a long march of upwards of 20 miles, encumbered with knapsacks and other luggage. The day was uncommonly warm, and no water to be had on the road; however, we were brought up, in order of battle. The French being strongly posted in a thick wood, to the number of 40,000 men, including cavalry and lancers, gave us very little time to look around us ere the fight commenced on both sides, in an awful and destructive manner, they having every advantage of us, both as to position and numbers, particularly in cavalry, as the British dragoons had not yet come up.

A scrawl at the bottom of the letter indicates that this is part 1 of 4.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows are dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

Front Of The Cottage
You stand in front of a large two storey cottage . A field of barley lies to the North. A path leads around the side of the cottage to the southwest. The cottage itself is directly south, the entrance blocked by a heavy oak door. 

In the field to the north you can see something nailed to a post.

The Farm Path
You are standing on a muddy farm path. A wooden gate to the south leads into a large barley field which forms part of a patchwork vista of yellow and brown draped over the distant landscape. The fields are separated by deep green foliage. 

Your journey here has been long and tiring. Beyond the field to the south you can see a thatched-roof cottage, a place you had once felt a connection with. A place you had once called home. In spite of your aching feet, the cottage no longer feels like an inviting respite. 

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

The weather is overcast and a gentle rain is falling, casting a damp film across the landscape.  

You see a small black cat sheltering under some nearby foliage.

The Barley Field
As you enter the barley field, your mind drifts to the fields of battle in the aftermath of Waterloo. The casualties were horrendous, the victory far from glorious. Many of the soldiers who died that day, the &quot;scum of the earth&quot; as Wellington had described them, had been recruited from villages and hamlets nearby. Wellington had later claimed  that it was &quot;really wonderful that we should have made these men into the fine fellows they are.&quot; You consider the barrenness of that statement  now that tens of thousands of those fine fellows were dead. Many of those who survived were not the same as they were before the war, having succumbed to war exhaustion or madness, or worse.

The chill wind is making it hard to breathe, and you begin to feel light headed. Further south through the fields you can see the old farm cottage. 

An old rotting wooden post is here. Propped up against the post, standing to attention, is a lone scarecrow.

    <result xml:space="preserve">In the winter of 1815, after countless millions had perished, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end. The little corporal Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France for the decade previous, was exiled to the volcanic island of St Helena where he would see out the last six years of his life.

The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the start of a great agricultural depression in the United Kingdom that would last for a quarter of a century. Many farms succumbed to abandonment and disrepair as both landlords and tenants fell into bankruptcy.

It is in the wake of this ruin, far from the bloody fields of Waterloo and Rocquencourt, that you find yourself standing on a long farm road in Suffolk, surrounded by fields of oat, barley and wheat. A dull lifelessness hangs in the air like the fog of war. All is silent, save for the cries of carrion crow circling above. You feel your heart longing for the rural paradise now lost to time and neglect.

Five hundred miles away, a young author called Mary Shelley has finished writing her first novel, &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;...

The scarecrow&apos;s head is made from a hessian sack, onto which has been drawn the approximation of a face. You can not tell whether the scarecrow is smiling or frowning, and his eyes stare blankly through you. The scarecrow is soaked through with rain - he has clearly been standing in this field for some time.

As you stare at the scarecrow, you feel a deep nausea as you come to accept an affinity with him. You consider the folly in his defence of fields that have been abandoned and ravaged by disease. His battlefield is a barren waste, his war over. He has been standing here so long, the crows are no longer afraid of him. Perhaps now the fight is over, they are his only companions.
